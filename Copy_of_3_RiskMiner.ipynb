        "## Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Setup and Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm has been implemented to discover optimal alpha formulas for financial data analysis. The MCTS process follows four main phases: Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation. The search explores the space of possible formulas by evaluating their effectiveness in predicting stock returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Steps in the MCTS Process:\n",
        "1. **Selection**: The UCB1 algorithm is used to balance exploration (trying less-explored nodes) and exploitation (choosing nodes that previously returned higher rewards). The node with the highest UCB1 score is selected for expansion.\n",
        "2. **Expansion**: Once a node is selected, it is expanded by generating a new child node. This involves creating a new formula by randomly combining financial data features (e.g., MOM90, CFO, ATR_7, etc.) with operators (e.g., +, -, *, /).\n",
        "3. **Simulation**: The newly generated formula is evaluated by simulating its performance, with a reward assigned based on the formula’s effectiveness. This step involves calculating a reward, which later guides backpropagation.\n",
        "4. **Backpropagation**: The reward from the simulation is backpropagated through the tree, updating the visit count and value for each node along the path. This ensures that the MCTS learns from past explorations and prioritizes promising nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Top 5 Formulas Discovered by MCTS:\n",
        "1. **Formula**: MOM90 - marketcap_daily, **Score**: 0.0663\n",
        "2. **Formula**: ROCP - ATR_7, **Score**: 0.0656\n",
        "3. **Formula**: CFO - ev_daily, **Score**: 0.0650\n",
        "4. **Formula**: CDLSEPARATINGLINES - ev_daily, **Score**: 0.0650\n",
        "5. **Formula**: CDLHIGHWAVE - low, **Score**: 0.0609\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis of Results:\n",
        "- The top formulas discovered involve combinations of financial features (e.g., MOM90, marketcap_daily, ATR_7) and arithmetic operations, reflecting potentially strong relationships between these features and stock returns.\n",
        "- The scores reflect the effectiveness of each formula based on the reward function. Higher scores indicate formulas that exhibit better predictive power for stock returns.\n",
        "- The process has successfully identified several promising formulas, which can be further tested in backtesting to evaluate their performance on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Improvements Implemented:\n",
        "- **Incorporated All Features**: The MCTS now uses the entire feature set from the dataset rather than a subset, allowing the discovery of more diverse and potentially stronger alphas.\n",
        "- **Intermediate Rewards**: Each formula was evaluated per ticker, with rewards propagated through the tree. This ensures that the formulas with the most robust performance across all tickers are prioritized.\n",
        "- **Best Alphas Across Tickers**: The selected formulas were tested on individual tickers, ensuring that the best alphas are identified for each specific ticker, avoiding random combinations of unrelated tickers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps involve refining the alpha discovery process, backtesting these formulas on unseen data, and ensuring only the best-performing alphas are retained for further evaluation.\n"

        "\n",
        "This section focuses on the successful optimization of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) process through the integration of a risk-seeking policy and quantile-based reward adjustments. These enhancements enabled the search for high-reward strategies while ensuring diversity in the formulas generated, all while incorporating the entire feature set from the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps Completed\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formula Generation**:\n",
        "- Formulas were generated using the full set of financial features, such as `netincdis`, `roa`, `ps_daily`, and technical indicators like `MACD_signal_fast`, `LINEARREG_INTERCEPT_200`, and `EMA_10`.\n",
        "- The generation process ensured diversity by incorporating various mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and avoided trivial repetitions by checking the uniqueness of each formula.\n",
        "- The use of a risk-seeking policy helped push the generation of more aggressive, high-reward formulas.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) Exploration**:\n",
        "- The UCB1 algorithm was used during the selection phase of MCTS, ensuring that nodes with high potential rewards were prioritized. This approach increased exploration and avoided converging too quickly on local optima, favoring the discovery of high-reward strategies.\n",
        "- The exploration parameter was adjusted to seek out riskier nodes, encouraging a broader search space for high-reward alphas.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quantile-Based Reward Calculation**:\n",
        "- The reward function was modified to incorporate quantile-based adjustments, prioritizing formulas in the upper quantiles of reward distribution.\n",
        "- Information Coefficient (IC) was calculated for each formula to measure its predictive power. Additionally, the system favored those formulas performing within the top quantiles to emphasize high-reward strategies.\n",
        "- This approach ensured that the MCTS process did not converge too early on safe, low-risk strategies and instead prioritized formulas with higher potential returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MCTS Execution**:\n",
        "- The MCTS process was executed for 1000 iterations, with nodes being selected, expanded, and backpropagated based on their performance during the simulation phase.\n",
        "- The top formulas were then identified based on their average score, reflecting both IC and the quantile-based reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The top 5 formulas discovered through MCTS with quantile optimization are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Formula**: `netincdis - EMA_10`, **Score**: 0.1406\n",
        "2. **Formula**: `roa - EMA_10`, **Score**: 0.1177\n",

        "5. **Formula**: `LINEARREG_INTERCEPT_200 - EMA_5`, **Score**: 0.1064\n",
        "\n",
        "These formulas exhibited a strong balance between high reward and diversity. The inclusion of technical indicators (`MACD_signal_fast`, `LINEARREG_INTERCEPT_200`) and financial features (`netincdis`, `roa`) in combination with quantile-based optimization helped prioritize strategies with high predictive power.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "**Diversity**: The generated formulas demonstrated diversity, validating the effectiveness of the formula generation process and quantile-based reward adjustments. The formulas incorporated varied combinations of operands and operators, and trivial repetitions were successfully minimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Risk-Seeking Behavior**: The high scores across the top formulas confirmed that the MCTS algorithm targeted high-reward strategies as intended. By using a quantile-based reward system and adjusting the UCB1 exploration parameter, the algorithm was able to prioritize riskier, high-reward nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quantile Optimization**: The quantile-based reward adjustment led to the discovery of formulas that consistently performed within the upper range of outcomes, ensuring that the strategies identified were robust and not overly conservative.\n",
        "\n",
        "This progress provides a strong foundation for the next phase, where the discovered formulas will be further refined and evaluated through backtesting on historical data.\n"

        "\n",
        "This section highlights the successful implementation of alpha pool management, focusing on dynamically updating and maintaining the best-performing formulas discovered during MCTS iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps Completed\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Alpha Pool Creation and Maintenance**:\n",
        "    - An alpha pool was created to store the top-performing formulas discovered during the MCTS process. The pool has a fixed size, with new alphas being added and weaker ones pruned dynamically.\n",
        "    - Each time a new alpha formula was discovered and evaluated, it was added to the pool. If the pool exceeded the defined size limit, the weakest formulas were removed based on their adjusted Information Coefficient (IC) and diversity, measured by mutual IC (mutIC).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Alpha Updating**:\n",
        "    - To maintain the quality of the alpha pool, formulas were dynamically updated. The weight of each alpha was recalculated based on its IC and a diversity adjustment, ensuring that redundant or underperforming alphas were identified and removed.\n",
        "    - The IC and mutIC metrics were used to ensure that formulas remained both diverse and effective, reducing the risk of overfitting or redundancy within the pool.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **MCTS Execution with Alpha Pool Management**:\n",
        "    - The MCTS process was executed for 1000 iterations, dynamically adding new formulas to the alpha pool as they were discovered. The alpha pool was continuously pruned to maintain only the top-performing formulas.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The top 5 formulas discovered through MCTS with quantile optimization and alpha pool management are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Formula**: `evebit / ATR_14`, **Score**: 0.1563  \n",
